        <p id="aboutMePara">
            My name is Siddharth Verma and I am currently in my third semester of Health Informatics Technology at Centennial College. 
            Anything related to technology interests me and I like to explore different and new types of technology that we are surrounded with nowadays. 
            I also come from a healthcare background and so I decided to pursue Health Informatics Technology at Centennial College since I felt that this program will provide a good blend of technology and techniques involved in software/web development and healthcare. Outside of school, I like to keep myself physically and mentally fit. I also like to listen to music and read. Below is a link to my resume that outlines my study, work and volunteer experience. 
            It further outlines my projects that I have worked on ever since I started my journey in the world of software development.
